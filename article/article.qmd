## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

One of the prime usage-based mechanisms of language change is the reducing effect [@bybee_usage_2006]. The reducing effect dictates that, as constructions are used often, their phonetic representations become more sparse.  This entails that high frequency constructions experience more severe reduction, while low frequency constructions experience reduction to a lesser extent. In addition, high frequency constructions are also said to undergo reduction at a faster rate [@bybee_phonology_2003]. The reason for the reduction process itself is so-called "neuromotor automation", according to @bybee_usage_2006 [5].

The process of neuromotor automation is assumed to be the result of two adjacent processes: temporal reduction and substantive reduction [@mowrey_articulatory_1987]. Temporal reduction entails the compression of several articulatory gestures[^gesture] into one (i.e. assimilation or cluster simplification), while substantive reduction entails the reduction in magnitude of an articulatory gesture (i.e. vowel reduction to schwa). The combined effect of these two processes is then known under the more general term "reduction". We assume both these effects when we further use the term "reduction".

[^gesture]: An articulatory gesture can be defined as a movement of an articulator with an observable effect [@browman_articulatory_2009].

### Empirical traces of reduction

The existence of the reducing effect has been demonstrated through several studies. One of the earliest examples is @fidelholtz_word_1975, who shows that frequency can be related to vowel reduction in several phonetic contexts in English. Another example is @pluymaekers_lexical_2005: they tested the reduction of affixes in Dutch and found that reduction was positively related to the frequency of the carrier word. Finally, @bybee_effect_1999 discuss how English *don't* is most likely to be reduced in constructions where *don't* is highly frequent (like *I don't know*). These three studies respectively show that reduction can apply to the lexicon, morphology, and constructions as a whole.

In addition, several other synchronic factors have been found to influence the rate of reduction. In her overview of reduction, @ernestus_acoustic_2014 mentions the phenomenon to be influenced by phonological context (e.g. assimilation to ease the overlap of articulatory gestures), speech rate (reducing the number of gestures to be able to speak faster) and predictability [reducing the number of gestures because they are predictable from the context, independent from frequency, @bell_predictability_2009]. While we agree that these factors are also important in "on-line" reduction, in this study, we focus on raw frequency in a diachronic context.

### Unknowns in the cause of reduction {#sec-underspecification}

While we know from corpus studies that reduction patterns can indeed be found in speech data, and are therefore likely to exist, what we cannot glean from corpora is the causality that led to these patterns. As a corpus only shows the resulting *effect* of language use on a large scale, we cannot see the decisions on the level of the individual that caused there to be a reduction effect in the first place. We do not know, should reality have looked different, whether the reduction effect would still exist, as we do not know the factors that make the reduction effect occur. In other words, while we see the reducing effect in corpus data, we do not really know what *causes* it. In this section, we will discuss three unknowns (TODO?) in reduction theory, the specifics of which have remained opaque in corpus studies.

The first unknown pertains to the frequency difference between the different constructions that undergo reduction. We know from Bybee's theory that high-frequency constructions reduce differently from low-frequency constructions [@bybee_phonology_2003, 11]. This implies that a frequency difference between constructions is necessary, but it is unspecified how that frequency difference needs to be realised. This leads to our first research question:

1. What frequency distribution do constructions in language have to follow for the reducing effect to arise as expected?[^expected]

The second unknown revolves around an explicit link between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker. @bybee_phonology_2003 [11] states:

> If sound changes are the result of phonetic processes that apply in real time as words are used, then those words that are used more often have more opportunity to be affected by phonetic processes.

The expectation by Bybee is that frequency in itself should be enough for reduction to arise organically. This implies there is no need for an explicit link that causes speakers to reduce more in high-frequency constructions than in low-frequency constructions. As this premise has not been tested, it is more an assumption rather than a finding. Therefore, our second research question is as follows:

2. Does there need to be an explicit link between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker for the reducing effect to arise as expected?[^expected]

Finally, existing theory on reduction also does not interact with the prospect of possible ambiguity. Reduction is, in essence, the act of expressing the same content in a narrower acoustic representation. Gradually, however, that also means that these representations will start looking alike more. It is currently unclear whether that implies some ambiguity avoidance mechanism is required to make sure that communicative confusion is avoided. Our final research question, then, is as follows:

3. Does there need to be an ambiguity avoidance mechanism for the reducing effect to arise as expected?[^expected]

[^expected]: For the reducing effect to arise "as expected", we mean that it should display the same properties as those we find in corpus data. Please see @sec-evaluation for an explicit definition of expected reduction behaviour.

Empirically, it is impossible to change reality in the past in order to trace any cascading effects in the long term in corpus data. To find the requirements of the reduction effect in spite of this, we turn to computer simulations. Computer simulations allow one to virtualise reality into a model in which virtual language users ("agents") communicate with each other on the basis of simple, local rules. The idea is that the interplay of their interactions leads to emergent linguistic behaviour, which in our case is the reducing effect. Our goal in this article is to investigate which specification of assumptions is needed for the language in our computer model to exhibit the reducing effect, displaying the same properties as those found in corpus data. Because we work with computer simulations, we can assume several outlooks on reality and the reducing effect, and try several assumptions in order to find the minimal requirements needed for the reducing effect to occur.

While the real world is far messier and noisier than the idealised world represented in our simulations, simulation results can nevertheless "suggest that such underlying principles may operate in the real world as well" [@stanford_revisiting_2013, 122]. In our specific case, a simulation might show that typical reduction behaviour does not arise out of the preconditions that are presupposed in the literature, or that additional preconditions are required. Such outcomes can be theoretically interesting, since they make the various aspects of reduction theory more explicit, and since they can function as a stepping stone for further experimental or empirical research.

## Model design

In this section, we will first discuss the core architecture of the simulation. This is the part of the simulation that will remain invariant across parameter permutations. Our core architecture is based on empirical research in the usage-based linguistics paradigm [as recommended by @loreto_theoretical_2010, 69]. Usage-based linguistics views language as a complex adaptive system, i.e. a system shaped through repeated use by language users [@beckner_language_2009]. This makes it a natural fit for our agent-based simulations, which operate on the same principle. After we have introduced all core mechanisms in our simulation, we will discuss the variable parts of our model and the initial implementation we chose. We implemented our model of the reduction effect in Python using the MESA library [@python-mesa-2020]. All source code is available online.[^github-link]

### Formalisation of speech {#sec-speech-formalisation}

For our reduction simulation, we made the decision to model speech using vector representations. Such vector representations are popular in the field of machine learning, both to represent meaning [@mikolov_efficient_2013] and acoustic information [@baevski_wav2vec_2020]. Since this model pertains to oral communication, having vector representations comparable to those found in the Speech Recognition field is especially interesting given the fact that reduction can also happen on a tonal level, e.g. in Mandarin [@de_smet_entrenchment_2016]. Such reduction effects cannot be encoded in a typical written form, but they can be using vectors if we assume that the vectors encode phonetic information on all levels; the vector dimensions can be thought of as representing different acoustic frequency ranges, with the vector values representing the energy in those ranges.

For the basis of our vectors, we made the deliberate decision not to use any data from actual natural languages, since we wanted our model to be maximally language agnostic. Instead, we opted to use randomly generated speech representations, generating a matrix of $V \times D$, with $V$ being the number of constructions[^ctx] in the vocabulary of the agents and $D$ being the number of dimensions.[^parameters] The values of the vectors are randomly generated natural numbers between 70 and 100. The vectors are generated in such a way that, at the starting point of the simulations, they sit far enough apart not to be confused with each other. Of course, once the vectors start reducing, this will change. An example of the vector representations for the constructions in our model is given in @tbl-model_design_speech_vector_examples. Note that the representations in agents' memories will have additional noise added to these vectors (see @sec-agent-memory).

[^ctx]: We made the decision to model constructions rather than individual words or sounds as constructions can be thought of as the most general units within usage-based linguistics that are eligible for undergoing reduction. 

|  Construction  | Dim 1 | Dim 2 | Dim 3 | ... | Dim $D$ |
| -------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Construction 1 | 71    | 89    | 85    | ...   | 83    |
| Construction 2 | 87    | 72    | 70    | ...   | 98    |
| ... | | | | |
| Construction $V$ | 88    | 76    | 91    | ...   | 88    |

: Example base vector representations for the constructions in the simulation model. {#tbl-model_design_speech_vector_examples}

[^parameters]: We will later discuss the exact parameters chosen.

Note also that, for the sake of simplicity, the meaning of the constructions in our simulations is not explicitly modelled. Instead, we implicitly assume that all meanings remain constant across different exemplars of the same constructions.

### Agent memory {#sec-agent-memory}

The agents in our model have a memory which can store multiple realisations for each construction, a so-called exemplar memory [from "exemplar theory", @bybee_usage_2006]. This allows for variation among those constructions, e.g. different realisations of *yes*: *yeah*, *yep*, *yup* ... The same realisation can be stored in the exemplar memory multiple times as the result of more frequent exposure. Therefore, the typical realisation of a specific construction can naturally evolve as new realisations are added, i.e. reduced realisations.

In our model, each agent has a memory of $L$ exemplars. This memory can be thought of as a matrix of size $L \times D$. The $L$ available slots in memory are pre-assigned to specific constructions according to the selected frequency distribution, with a lower limit of TODO. @fig-memory_distribution shows an example distribution with a memory of size 20 and four constructions, organised according to a Zipfian distribution. It is clear how the number of exemplars in memory taper off as the constructions become less frequent. Note that this does not mean that all exemplars belonging to a single construction are all the same: more and less reduced vectors can co-exist together. An example of an agent's memory with different vector associations can be found in @tbl-model_design_agent_memory_example.

![An example of the distribution of four constructions in an agent memory of size 20, organised according to a Zipfian distribution. The first construction appears eight times, the second construction five times, the third construction four times and the fourth construction three times.](tikz/memory_distribution.svg){#fig-memory_distribution}

|  Exemplar  | Dim 1 | Dim 2 | Dim 3 | ... | Dim $D$ | Associated construction |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| Exemplar 1 | 31    | 42    | 100    | ...   | 15    | Construction 1 |
| ... | | | | |
| Exemplar 16 | 27    | 37    | 27    | ...   | 97    | Construction 2 |
| Exemplar 17 | 24    | 35    | 29    | ...   | 96    | Construction 2 |
| ... | | | | |
| Exemplar $L$ | 44    | 39    | 69    | ...   | 80    | Construction $V$ |

: Example agent memory consisting of vector representations belonging to different constructions. {#tbl-model_design_agent_memory_example}

At the model initialisation stage, we fill each of the pre-assigned memory slots with vector representations from @tbl-model_design_speech_vector_examples. In this model initialisation stage, vector representations are not copied to an agent's memory one-to-one. Instead, noise is added in order to account for the natural variation in different speakers' idiomatic patterns. This noise added is drawn from a normal distribution with $\mu = 5$ and $\sigma = 1$. Substantially larger noise patterns would cause the distinctions between the exemplars of different constructions to become lost. Noise is added to each exemplar individually. If an agent starts with five exemplars of specific constructions in their memory, all five will be slightly different.

Because an agent's memory is limited to size $L$, whenever a new exemplar needs to be stored, an older exemplar needs to be removed or "forgotten". We apply the logic that the oldest exemplar of the construction in question is replaced. An example of the forgetting mechanic for a given construction is given in @tbl-model_design_forgetting_example.

|  Exemplar  | Age in model iterations | 
| ---- | ----- |
| ~~Exemplar 1~~ | 5920 |
| Exemplar 2 | 4780 |
| Exemplar 3 | 3009 |
| Exemplar 4 | 1231 |

#### Why no global memory?

Usage-based theories of language generally take a very broad view on memory. Usually, memory is conceptualised as a large space that is shared by all sounds, constructions at once [i.e. todo referenties]. Our decision to pre-assign memory slots according to the chosen frequency distribution seems a step backwards in this regard, especially given the idea by @kretzschmar_language_2015 [32] that Zipfian curves simply arise naturally when we take any subcategorisation of language. Therefore, we should just be able to implement a global memory for each agent, and see the chosen frequency distribution arise naturally in the agents' memories.

In principle, it is true that such a bottom-up approach is possible. However, given the restrictions in a limited computer model, we opted to take a shortcut to guarantee the cognitive plausibility of our model. While we have no doubts that in the context of real human memory, certain frequency distributions need not be presupposed, our memory of 1000 exemplars is just too small to guarantee the stability of lower-frequency (todo?) constructions. If we were to use a global memory, new variants of high frequency constructions would push out exemplars of low frequency constructions too easily, leading to unreliable representations of those constructions. Because it is unfortunately computationally intractable to equip agents with memories tallying hundreds of thousands of exemplars, we opted to simply assume the presupposed effect and model the frequency distribution directly in memory.

### Reduction {#sec-reduction}

At speech time (see @sec-language-game), the speaker agent has the opportunity to reduce the exemplar vector representation that they retrieved from memory. Our implementation of reduction is extremely simple: a set reduction value $R$ is removed from all dimensions of the vector at once, with $R$ also being the floor value for any dimension of a vector. Without the floor value $R$, vectors would be able to reduce all the way to zero, which is an acoustic representation of silence. Of course, communication through silence is also possible, but this contextually derivative situation is beyond the scope of our model. A schematic representation of reduction is given in @fig-model_design_reduction.

### Language game and course of the simulation {#sec-language-game}

We mentioned that we estimate that the interaction between agents, given specific preconditions, is naturally conducive to reducing behaviour. In this section, we will explain this interactional behaviour of our virtual speakers and hearers in more detail.

At each step in the simulation, each agent in the simulation enters into a "conversation" at random with another randomly selected agent. The agent initiating the conversation functions as the speaker, the other agent functions as the hearer. In this conversation, speaker and hearer play a so-called "language game" [@smith_models_2014], the core of our simulation. In a language game, a speaker and a hearer agent perform a joint task rooted in language, the execution of this task naturally exerting some influence on the way language is used or organised. In our simulation, the goal of the language game is for the speaker to communicate a specific construction to the hearer, which the hearer then has to understand successfully. The exact course of the language game is as follows:

**Speaker**

1. The speaker chooses a construction to utter from the $V$ constructions available. The probability of each construction is influenced by the chosen frequency distribution (see @sec-underspecification-filling).[^zipfian-note] This parallellism between speaking frequency and observed frequency is known "probability matching" [@labov_principles_1994].
2. The speaker chooses an exemplar vector representation to utter for that construction. This exemplar is retrieved from the agent's memory. There is no mechanism influencing the probability of a specific exemplar being chosen. Of course, if a specific neighbourhood area is more dense, there is a higher probability of the chosen exemplar coming from that area.
3. With a probability of $p$, reduction is applied (see @sec-reduction).
4. The (potentially reduced) vector is communicated to the hearer.

**Hearer**

1. The hearer "hears" the vector communicated by the speaker.
2. The hearer interprets the vector representation of the speaker. They calculate the Manhattan distance (see @eq-manhattan_distance) between the spoken vector and their entire exemplar memory, and select all exemplars lower or equal to threshold $n$. The constructions associated with those exemplars are tallied, and the most frequent construction is accepted as the understood construction. In the case of a tie, communication fails and no exemplars are saved. In the case that no exemplars were selected, communication fails and no exemplars are saved. 
3. The heard exemplar is saved in the hearer's memory and is associated with the understood construction. The speaker does not adapt their own memory to keep the model design as simple as possible [todo literatuur ding lezen].

[^zipfian-note]: Note that we do not explicitly model a world or ground. The extralinguistic world is assumed through the assumed frequency distribution. For our model, the addition of an outside world with events would not have any added value, which is why we implemented agents about the world in this way.

![A schematic overview of the language game played by the speaker and hearer. The diagram shows the different steps of the language game. For the speaker, this means: choosing a construction, choosing an associated exemplar, applying reduction, and speaking the resulting vector representation. For the hearer, this means: hearing the exemplar, interpreting it by tallying the exemplars in the neighbourhood of the communicated vector location, and then finally committing the exemplar to memory.](language_game.svg){#fig-model_design_language_game}

$$
d(X, Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{D} |x_i - y_i|.
$$ {#eq-manhattan_distance}

Note that we deliberately left out any feedback mechanism from the language game. We assume that our agents can only communicate through language. Our intention was to make reduction work without the hearer agent knowing whether what they understood was indeed the construction intended by the speaker. If we implemented a way to communicate "perfect" feedback from speaker to hearer, there would be no point for our agents to communicate through language. In this way, the task our agents face also becomes harder. They need to evolve the language system into a more sparse representation without any feedback of how effective that representation actually is.

### Moving away from the unknowns {#sec-underspecification-filling}

We saw in @sec-underspecification that several aspects of reduction theory are unknown or underspecified. Through our computer simulations, we will attempt to move away from these unknowns and build a minimal set of assumptions that leads to the reducing effect with all its properties. Our strategy throughout is to start with minimal but motivated assumptions. If these prove to be insufficient, we will make the specification more complex. As a reminder, these are the three unknowns defined in @sec-underspecification:

1. What frequency difference is required between different constructions?
2. Does there need to be an explicit association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker?
3. Does there need to be an ambiguity avoidance mechanism?

As for (1), the minimal, motivated assumption can be inferred easily from corpus data. Indeed, words, constructions and in fact most other units in language follow Zipf's Law [@zipf_psycho-biology_1965]. Zipf's Law dictates that many "units" in language (words, constructions, sounds ...) naturally occur according to a power law in which rank is inversely related to frequency. This means that the first item in a Zipfian distribution is twice as frequent as the second item, three times as frequent as the third item, and so on. In practice, this leads to an extremely unbalanced distribution with few highly frequent items, and a long tail of infrequent items. This uneven distribution is also called an "A-curve" by @kretzschmar_language_2015. For our simulation, this has the consequence that in the construction choice stage (Speaker step 1 in @sec-language-game), agents are more likely to talk about high-frequent constructions rather than low-frequent constructions. In addition, the exemplars in an agent's memory will also follow the Zipfian distribution ["probability matching" in @labov_principles_1994].

As for (2), we suppose the most minimal option and initially assume there not to be an explicit relation between frequency and willingness of reduction. This assumption can be defended theoretically, as the "Principle of Least Effort" [@zipf_human_1949], dictates that when possible, language users will attempt to conserve as much energy as possible when speaking. Initially, then, we assume that this principle holds universally, regardless of frequency.

As for (3), we also started minimal and assumed that no ambiguity avoidance mechanism was required. We have no theoretical grounds for this assumption, other than the fact that this is the most minimal assumption possible.

Note that there is no built-in assumption which dictates that frequent constructions should reduce faster and to a larger extent than less frequent constructions. Rather, this is the emergent behaviour that needs to occur naturally out of the interplay of the different assumptions.

## Methodology

Because we use computer simulations, we apply a different methodology from traditional, empirical research. In this section, we will explain how we will analyse the simulation behaviour, and how we will evaluate the model as a whole, particularly how we test whether the minimal assumptions from @sec-underspecification-filling lead to the occurrence of reduction as defined by @bybee_usage_2006.

### Expected behaviour {#sec-expected-behaviour}

We will consider a set of preconditions to be conducive to the reducing effect if the following is true:

1. The language system has reorganised itself to express the same constructions using more efficient representations.
1. More frequent constructions have reduced to a greater extent than less frequent constructions.
1. Communication between agents remains successful. If the language system has reorganised itself in a way that makes effective communication impossible, the simulation has failed to simulate realistic conditions. Nonetheless, some tradeoff between communicative effort and communicative success can be seen as normal.

If the behaviour of a simulation corresponds with any of these three statements not being true, then we will say that that simulation does not produce behaviour equivalent to the behaviour found in corpus studies. The assumptions of that simulation are then said not to be conducive to the reducing effect.

### Evaluation {#sec-evaluation}

If any specification of assumptions produces behaviour which fully falls within the expected behaviour detailed in the previous section, then we can say that that specification is conducive to the reducing effect. The next question is whether this set is the *minimal* specification required to produce the reducing effect.

In order to check whether a specification of assumptions is also the minimal specification, we will apply the principle of Occam's Razor [@blythe_s-curves_2012]. This principle dictates that the simplest explanation for a phenomenon is presumptively the most likely one. Therefore, we will disable each precondition iteratively and check whether the simpler conditions can also produce the expected reduction behaviour. If a simpler specification produces equivalent behaviour, we have found a more minimal specification. If no simpler specification produces equivalent behaviour, our initial specification was already the minimal one.

### Parameters

In this section, we will run through the different parameters the model has and what values we chose for them. Parameters control specific aspects of our model, like how many agents inhabit our virtual world or how likely reduction is. One of the driving forces behind our parameter choices was computational tractability. Because we work with vector representations, and interpretation hinges on vector computations on an agent's entire exemplar memory, large agent counts, high dimension counts, large vocabulary sizes and large memory sizes all cause the time it takes to run a single simulation to balloon, even on powerful server hardware. Therefore, we made the decision to keep the parameters of the simulation modest. Review @tbl-parameters for an overview of our choices.

| Parameter | Explanation | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $N$ | Number of agents | 25 |
| $V$ | Number of constructions | 100 |
| $D$ | Number of vector dimensions | 10 |
| $L$ | Number of exemplars in memory | 1000 |
| $R$ | Value subtracted from exemplar vector at reduction time. Also functions as threshold floor value. A vector dimension cannot reduce below this point. | 5 |
| $n$ | Neighbourhood size. Only exemplars within this range count towards the interpretation of a vector. | 5 |
| $p$ | Reduction probability at speech time | 0.5 |

## Results

In this section, we will go over the results produced by the model operationalised according to the requirements detailed in the previous sections. More specifically, we will check if the model behaviour adheres to the expected behaviour defined in @sec-expected-behaviour.

### Base model {#sec-base-model}

First, we tested the simulation model with all minimal assumptions from @sec-underspecification-filling. As a reminder, this minimal specification is as follows:

1. Zipfian frequency difference between constructions
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. No ambiguity avoidance mechanism

We will discuss the behaviour of the simulation by going over the "checklist" defined in @sec-expected-behaviour, viz.: 

1. The language system has reorganised itself to express the same constructions using more efficient representations.
2. More frequent constructions have reduced to a greater extent than less frequent constructions.
3. Communication between agents remains successful.

The formulas at the basis of all visualisations can be found in the Appendix.

As for (1), we can see in @fig-base-model-l1-general that the average L1, i.e. the average energy in the acoustic representations of constructions (see @sec-speech-formalisation) of the constructicon of the agents drops sharply and then remains more or less constant. Therefore, we can say that, indeed, the system seems to have reorganised itself to be more efficient. Of course, given the non-zero probability of reduction (see @tbl-parameters), this is to be expected.

With respect to (2), @fig-base-model-l1-per-construction shows the average L1 of each construction separately. Recall that we expect frequent constructions to reduce a great extent, and faster as well. We indeed see that, generally speaking, frequent constructions (at the left of the graph) have lower L1 values than less frequent constructions (at the right of the graph).

In @fig-base-model-half-life-per-construction, the "half life" period for each construction is given. We show how many iterations in the simulation it took for every acoustic representation to reach half of its original energy. We see that for more frequent constructions (at the left of the graph), this half time tends to be reached faster than for less frequent constructions (at the right of the graph). Most constructions do not even show up in the graph, since they have not reached half their original energy yet.

Regarding (3), we refer to @fig-base-model-success. It shows both the micro-averaged and macro-averaged communicative success in the model. The micro-average refers to the total number of successes, and is influenced by Zipfian sampling. Because most of the speaking turns will concern the most frequent construction, the communicative success of that specific construction weighs significantly on the global, unadjusted success rate. The macro-average is an average across averages: each construction contributes equally towards the average, and therefore overrules Zipfian sampling. The macro-average gives a better of idea of communicative success in the language system as a whole.

We see in @fig-base-model-success that overall, communicative success in the model remains above chance level, although it does decrease. As we mentioned, it is expected that there is some trade-off between sparsity and communicative success, and the model results arguably remain within this margin. However, the confusion matrix in @fig-base-model-matrix paints a different picture: for the top 35 most frequent constructions, there is a large discrepancy between what the speaker intended (y axis) and what the hearer heard (x axis). More specifically, several frequent constructions seem to become confused with the most frequent construction. If we take English words as an illustration, this behaviour is comparable to speakers saying words like "have", "you", or "but", with hearers always hearing the most frequent English word "the". Obviously, this is a major flaw in the communication system of the agents, and it also does not correspond with realistic linguistic behaviour: reduction effects in real life do not lead to mass confusion. 

@fig-base-model-confusion-ratio shows the "correct interpretation ratio" for the ten most frequent constructions. The ratio expresses from 0 to 1 what share of exemplars, across agents, comes from successful interactions between agents. If an agent mistakes a heard form for a form that actually stands for another construction, the exemplar collection for the correct construction becomes diluted: another form is now also (wrongly) associated with that construction. If the exemplar collection for a specific construction contains a lot of mishearings, its correct interpretation ratio goes down. Here specifically, we see that the most frequent construction has a lower correct interpretation ratio than the other constructions. This makes sense, given how often it is confused with other constructions. The issue, however, is that we cannot know from these metrics exactly *how* the confusion arises and why the most frequent construction specifically becomes the target of the confusion. To find out the cause of confusion, we built another model, which we will discuss in the next section.

### Cone model {#sec-cone-model}

The main reason why we cannot reliably investigate the cause of confusion in the base model stems from the high dimensionality of the vectors. Because we work in a 10-dimensional space, there is no straightforward way to see how the vectors evolve over time. Unfortunately, dimensionality reduction techniques obscure a large share of the variation in the vectors, and are therefore unreliable to estimate the actual course of the acoustic representations.

The solution seems simple: reducing the number of dimensions to just two, which allows you to plot the acoustic representations accurately and reliably. This is indeed the solution we opted for, but with a few adjustments. We chose to represent the acoustic space as a cone, because this brings the properties of a two-dimensional space closer to the behaviour of the multi-dimensional space: all representations have a straight path to the origin (there is no need to go "through" another representation), and the phonetic space becomes more sparse as one nears the origin. Other adjustments are mechanical adaptations to the conic shape: all exemplars now reduce by moving at a straight angle towards the origin, and all constructions start at an equal radius of 250 TODO from the origin. We limit ourselves to just ten constructions for this demonstration.

@fig-cone-model-group shows the vector space both at the beginning of the simulation and after 700 iterations. @fig-cone-model-angle-vocabulary-plot-2d-begin shows that, at the start of the simulation, the exemplars of different constructions are well spaced out. However, as the acoustic representations become sparser (i.e. move closer towards point 0,0), the space *between* representations also becomes smaller. This has the side-effect that the proximity of the exemplars of more frequent constructions will start to disturb the interpretation process described in @sec-language-game. Because our interpretation system hinges on frequency, the presence of a more frequent construction in the neighbourhood will skew this system, with the more frequent exemplars dominating perception. Mishearings of the associated constructions are the consequence. As the acoustic space becomes sparser and exemplars move even closer towards each other, more frequent constructions will iteratively start to overtake less frequent constructions until the most frequent form dominates the entire acoustic space. We see this in @fig-cone-model-angle-vocabulary-plot-2d-end: where the second and third most frequent constructions (green and blue respectively) first outnumber other constructions in their proximity, they become outnumbered once their interpretation neighbourhood becomes influenced by the most frequent construction (red).

The reason why we do not see this iterative process reflected in the base model is again the high dimensionality of the vectors. In the cone model, there are only two dimensions in which constructions can inch closer together. In the 100-dimensional model, the most frequent construction can be the closest neighbours of multiple constructions at once. The mechanics behind the confusion, however, are the same. A possible solution for these mishearings is given in the next section.

### Re-entrance model {#sec-reentrance-model}

Now that we can see the mishearings happen in real time, the question arises how they can be avoided. A complicating factor is that we intentionally did not incorporate a feedback mechanism in our simulation: hearers cannot know that they are mistaking a construction for another, so they cannot say "come again?". Vice versa, a speaker cannot know whether a reduced form will cause a mishearing on behalf of the hearer, as they do not have access to the acoustic representations of the latter. As such, our model design without any feedback mechanism seems to lead to a linguistic catch 22.

Nevertheless, a solution within this design is possible on behalf of the speaker. Since language production is considered a complex, automatic and unconscious process, its output cannot always be guaranteed to lead to communicative success. It is in this light that @steels_language_2003 has coined the term "re-entrance". Re-entrance can be understood as the application of a speaker's reception subsystem to their own linguistic utterances, to serve as a means of incomprehension prevention or repair. Steels argues that the concept is related to a speaker's inner voice. Re-entrance is mechanically straightforward: a speaker's intended production is routed through their own reception mechanism, and its adequacy is subsequently assessed. It is in exactly this way that we have implemented this mechanism in our simulation. If a speaker reduces an acoustic representation, we first let them reflect on whether they would understand the uttered form correctly themselves. If they would, communication can continue as planned. If they would not, reduction is reversed, and the unreduced form is communicated.

![A schematic overview of the language game played by the speaker and hearer, with re-entrance. Before speaking, the speaker checks whether they would understand the uttered form themselves. If they do, reduction is kept, but if they do not, reduction is reversed. The new elements in the overview are indicated in teal.](language_game_reentrance.svg){#fig-model_design_language_game_reentrance}

With this new precondition added to our basic assumptions, the model now behaves as expected. @fig-reentrance-model-l1-general shows an increase in sparsity, @fig-reentrance-model-l1-per-construction and @fig-reentrance-model-half-life-per-construction show reduction extent and speed to be influenced by frequency, @fig-reentrance-model-success shows adequate communicative success and @fig-reentrance-model-matrix and @fig-reentrance-model-confusion-ratio show little to no confusion. Therefore, it seems that an ambiguity avoidance mechanism is indeed required to obtain simulations results comparable with corpus data, leading to the following specification:

1. Zipfian frequency difference between constructions
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. Re-entrance as an ambiguity avoidance mechanism

### Evaluation

#### No Zipfian distribution, no feedback {#sec-no-zipfian-model}

We explained in @sec-evaluation that the key point of simulation research is the search for the minimal specification of conditions that produces a specific effect. This is our current minimal specification which is conducive to the reducing effect: 

1. Zipfian frequency difference between constructions
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. Re-entrance as an ambiguity avoidance mechanism

We know that (3) is essential for reducing effect behaviour, as the results for our base model (@sec-base-model) did not satisfy our expected behaviour. We cannot disable (2), as the association between frequency and reduction willingness was never implemented, and it also never proved necessary in the (successful) re-entrance model (@sec-reentrance-model). This leaves us with our Zipfian assumption in (1). Is it really needed to lead to the reducing effect?

To investigate this, we built a model in which we sample constructions from a completely flat distribution instead of a Zipfian one. This means that all constructions have the same probability of being selected, and they also all claim the same number of slots in agent memory. The difference between the two distributions is demonstrated in @fig-flat-distribution, where we show two distributions which both have 10,000 as the frequency of the most frequent construction.

The question is to what extent this change from Zipfian to flat frequency has an influence on the course of the simulation. From @fig-no-zipfian-model-success and @fig-base-model-matrix, we can tell that this model delivers poor performance. Communicative success is low, and confusion is ubiquitous. It is clear, then, that the Zipfian distribution seems relevant for maintaining communicative stability during reduction. The question rises, however, how and why this is the case.

To try and explain this behaviour, we have taken two approaches. In the first approach, we built feedback into the model. In the second approach, we increasingly skewed an exponential frequency distribution to check at what point communicative success matched the model with the Zipfian distribution without feedback. We will go over these two approaches in the following subsections.

#### No Zipfian distribution, feedback {#sec-no-zipfian-feedback-model}

In this subsection, we investigate the model behaviour of the following specification:

1. No frequency difference between constructions
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. Re-entrance as an ambiguity avoidance mechanism
4. Feedback allowed during communication

The addition of feedback adds another dimension to our model behaviour. At communication time, the hearer still uses their frequency-based approach to interpret the heard construction, but they now also receive a feedback signal from the speaker. If their interpretation was correct, they save the heard exemplar in their agent memory. If not, they do not save anything, and communication fails (i.e. there is no further repair mechanism). The revised flow of the language game is shown schematically in @fig-model_design_language_game_reentrance_feedback.

![A schematic overview of the language game played by the speaker and hearer, with re-entrance and feedback. After the exemplar is interpreted by the hearer, the speaker confirms whether this interpretation was correct. If so, the exemplar is saved, but if not, communication fails and nothing is saved. The new elements in the overview are indicated in teal.](language_game_reentrance_feedback.svg){#fig-model_design_language_game_reentrance_feedback}

When we look at the results, we see that the communicative chaos from the no feedback model has completely disappeared. Communication now proceeds without issue.

#### Increasingly skewed exponential distribution {#sec-exponential-model}

In the previous section, we saw that we can prevent communicative collapse in a flat distribution model if we incorporate a feedback mechanism. However, we saw in @sec-reentrance-model that with a Zipfian distribution, such a feedback mechanism is not necessary. To confirm this pattern, we investigate the link between a skewed (exponential) distribution and communicative success. We use the following specification:

1. Exponential frequency difference between constructions (to a varying degree)
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. Re-entrance as an ambiguity avoidance mechanism
4. No feedback allowed during communication

Our exponential distribution is organised according to @eq-exponential_distribution. We vary the skew in the exponential distribution from $\lambda = log_{10}\left(1\right)$ to $\lambda = log_{10}\left(3\right)$.

$$
\operatorname{freq}(x) = e^{-\lambda} \cdot x
$$ {#eq-exponential_distribution}

Because this set of models covers a wide array of models, we build an aggregation graph over the model outcomes. @eq-exponential_distribution shows the average communicative success for each lambda parameter at the end of the model runs. It is clear that the more skewed the distribution becomes, the better the model performs. Broadly speaking, the more the distribution starts to resemble a typical Zipfian distribution, the better the model performs communicatively. We turn to the discussion to attempt to explain this behaviour.

ALLES HIERONDER WELLICHT VOOR DE VUILBAK

To answer this question, we look at @fig-no-zipfian-model-l1-per-construction. One can see that, generally speaking, there is hardly any difference in average L1 value among constructions. As the simulation unfolds, any variation in L1 is flattened down. In contrast, we saw in @fig-base-model-l1-per-construction (repeated below) that the Zipfian simulation maintains a clear distinction between high frequent and less frequent constructions. Highly frequent constructions have a lower L1 floor compared to higher frequency values, and this distinction is maintained over time.

In @fig-no-zipfian-model-half-life-per-construction, we again show the "half life" period for each construction. We see that very few acoustic representations reduce to half their energy in the Zipfian simulation, in contrast to the linear simulation, where many representations have indeed reduced at least halfway. This shows that, if frequency is assumed to be linear, reduction goes faster and applies to more constructions than when frequency is assumed to be Zipfian.

In this regard, we can say that expected behaviour #2 (see @sec-expected-behaviour) is violated, since linear frequency does not lead to any stark differences in reduction speed and extent between high and low frequency items. Therefore, we have not successfully modelled the reducing effect. As such, we now know that in our simulation, only the following specification successfully leads to the reducing effect:

1. Zipfian frequency difference between constructions
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. Re-entrance as an ambiguity avoidance mechanism

## Discussion {#sec-discussion}

In this article, we attempted to find the minimal conditions necessary to produce the reducing effect as described by @bybee_usage_2006. We found that at least the following specification of specifications was required to lead to the reducing effect:

1. Zipfian frequency difference between constructions
2. No association between frequency and reduction willingness on behalf of the speaker
3. Re-entrance as an ambiguity avoidance mechanism

If we replace the Zipfian distribution with a flat distribution, we also need an additional feedback mechanism to guarantee communicative stability. In this discussion section, we will go over the role of the Zipfian distribution, and what the necessity of the several requirements means for reduction theory and usage-based linguistics as a whole.

### Role of the Zipfian distribution

We saw that, paired with re-entrance, the Zipfian distribution can lead to a commmunicatively stable model that produces behaviour mimicking corpus data (@sec-reentrance-model). However, when we removed the Zipfian distribution and replaced it with a flat distribution, communication failed (@sec-no-zipfian-model). If we added feedback to the same specification, communication recovered (@sec-no-zipfian-feedback-model). In @sec-exponential-model, we saw that skewed feedback can be disabled and still lead to good results, as long as the distribution is decently skewed, i.e. comparable to a Zipfian distribution. In short, there seem to be two ways to achieve communicative success: either any distribution paired with feedback, or a heavily skewed distribution, like the Zipfian distribution, but without the requirement for feedback.

The major difference between the two strategies seems to lie in the way the evolution of representations is handled. If the relative frequency differences between the different constructions are relatively small, it is harder for all agents to collectively decide which construction can reduce first, second, third, etc. If each agent has a different opinion on which construction can take a specific, more efficient representation, communication is sure to go wrong. Mishearings can be exploited by agents to increasingly build out their own idiolects, i.e. their own distribution of the acoustic space, separate from other agents. If constructions are organised according to a skewed frequency distribution, agents are naturally inclined to use the same constructions more, and the same constructions attain the same reduction opportunities. In other words, it is much harder to reach consensus on the reduction process without a feedback mechanism if the frequency distribution is not overly facilitative in this regard.

Contrastively, the implementation of a feedback mechanism allows agents to "synchronise" their reduction paths, even in challenging situations. Even if agents attempt to reduce constructions in disjoint orders, the feedback mechanism does not allow them to abuse mishearings to move further away from other agents. This is why a flat distribution also works if feedback is enabled: there is another mechanism, separate from the frequency distribution, which is able to force the "invisible hand" of the reduction process into a certain direction.

Note, however, that we do not assume the reducing effect to be *the* reason a Zipfian distribution is commonplace in language. A purely linguistic explanation might be entirely misguided (? todo), as Zipfian distributions can be found in many aspects of reality (e.g. TODO). Regardless of their origin, however, Zipfian distributions can still be beneficial in the evolution of complex systems, like we see in our simulations. It is also not hard to imagine that a system that also works without an explicit feedback mechanism could be beneficial in situations where giving or receiving feedback is difficult, because of cognitive, ecological or other issues.

This ambiguity does make it hard to assess whether the Zipfian distribution is really a "required" assumption for the reducing effect. In a strict sense, it is not, since in the right circumstances with feedback, other distributions seem to work as well. Realistically, of course, the Zipfian frequency distribution seems to work in non-feedback circumstances as well, which makes it the most generally applicable specification, especially in light of the principle of Occam's Razor (see @sec-evaluation).

### Implications for reduction theory

In our simulation, we found that there is more to the reduction principle than just the link between usage and sparsity, as evidenced by the three preconditions. The Zipfian distribution of construction frequency together with the continuous drive to spontaneously reduce forms are the driving force behind the reduction effect proper. Finally, self-understanding on behalf of speakers acts as a safeguard and keeps the virtual linguistic system from derailing.

Finally, one detail of our implementation that has not been mentioned yet, but that seems important for the reduction effect theoretically, is that of acoustic-perceptual resolution and its consequences for the avoidance of a fractal organisation of acoustic representations. Perception in our model is based on spatial vicinity. All exemplars within a specified range contribute towards the understanding of a particular form, and this range is fixed. This has the consequence that there is no use in constructions reducing to infinitely smaller forms, as an agent's perceptual range remains the same. Should our model be updated to allow for reduction in increasingly smaller steps, representations could theoretically keep reducing ad infinitum while keeping their current distinctions ("fractal"). They would just appear at increasingly smaller scales, at least as long as agents are perceptually sensitive to these small differences.[^realism] We did not include the avoidance of this fractal property as a precondition for reduction, as we considered it moreso a detail of our implementation. Still, we think this detail is theoretically interesting and could be further investigated.

[^realism]: Humans are known not to be sensitive to minute differences in acoustic frequency. In fact, an entire rescaling of the human hearing range has been devised for speech recognition purposes ["Mel scale", @pedersen_mel_1965] in order to account for the insensitivity of the human ear to certain frequency distinctions, especially in the upper frequency range.

### Implications for usage-based linguistics

As of now, most discourse about exemplars in usage-based linguistics has centred around the categorisation and structure of exemplars, their link with prototypes and their cognitive realisation. In our simulation, we see that exemplars can also act  as buffers in situations where representations undergo sudden, considerable changes. Especially for high frequency constructions, the buffer effect works well, as these constructions are assumed to have a large number of exemplars in memory simply due to their sheer frequency of occurrence. Concurrently, this buffering process is especially effective for high frequency constructions in particular, as they have the most opportunity to undergo considerable changes in the first place.

In addition, the categorisation of exemplars is shown to not be as straightforward in our simulation as is assumed theoretically. While the idea is that proximity to other exemplars should suffice for correctly categorising or understanding representations, frequency effects can disrupt this process and can cause cascading confusion. Of course, our simulation does not feature any sort of context nor feedback mechanism, which could help mitigate this categorisation problem.

### Further research

There are several ways in which our model could be extended. The most obvious extension would be the inclusion of context. Indeed, while it was the very goal of our simulation to distill only the most fundamental aspects of the reduction effect, in real life situations, context contributes to how far a specific construction's representation can be reduced. If a construction is predictable from either its linguistic or its (real-life) situational context, there is a lesser need to express it fully. In this regard, it would be appropriate to turn our reduction model into a model of *probability* rather than one of frequency. TODO lezen Gregory et al.

Furthermore, our model currently does not account for the co-existence of reduced and unreduced forms on a diachronic level. While our exemplar model allows for a wide range of synchronic variation, agents will forget older, in our case unreduced forms once they fill up their exemplar memories. This leads to the loss of *I don't know* in favour of *dunno* over time, while both forms can also just co-exist. Other possible extensions include allowing constructions to disappear or varying the 'reducibility' of certain constructions to account for the fact that not *all* high frequency words seem eligible for reduction.

Finally, it would be valuable to bring the results of this simulation study into the real world by means of an experimental study (i.e. like @kirby_cumulative_2008). In this way, it can be investigated if and how the simulation study might be translated into the context of real people. In this regard, our findings *in silico* can serve as headlights to make the transition to research *in vivo* more straightforward.
