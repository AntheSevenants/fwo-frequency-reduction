1. More frequent constructions have reduced to a greater extent than less frequent constructions.
1. The language system has reorganised itself to express the same constructions using more efficient representations.
1. Communication between agents remains successful. If the language system has reorganised itself in a way that makes successful communication impossible, the simulation has failed to simulate realistic conditions. Nonetheless, some tradeoff between communicative effort and communicative success can be expected.
